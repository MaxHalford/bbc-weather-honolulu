# Accuracy of BBC Weather forecasts for Honolulu

This repository records the forecasts made by [BBC Weather](https://www.bbc.com/weather) for the city of [Honolulu, USA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Honolulu). Essentially, there's a GitHub Action that runs at each half hour and saves the latest forecasts. The data is stored in a separate branch called `data`. Therefore, the data is versioned. This allows going back into the past to see the forecasts that were made for any given hour in the (relative) future.

I made this after watching [Git scraping, the five minute lightning talk](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/) by Simon Willison. It blew my mind! I agree with Simon that collecting and versioning API through `git` is a powerful pattern. You could use this pattern to keep a ledger of any dynamic forecasting system, such as the predicted outcomes of football games. In these dynamical systems, the forecasts are updated because of newly available information. I think that it's super interesting to analyse how these forecasts evolve through time.
